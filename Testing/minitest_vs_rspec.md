# Minitest vs Rspec

Minitest is Ruby's default testing library and is part of Ruby's standard library.

Minitest is a bundled gem which is that it comes along with default Ruby installation

Minitest provides a simpler syntax and can do everything that Rspec can do.

Rspec is a DSL (domain specific language), its a DSL for writing tests. Minitrest can also use a DSL and can also be used in a way that reads like ordinary Ruby code.
