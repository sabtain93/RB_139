# Testing terminology

We write tests so when we make changes in our code, we dont have to manually verify everything is working.

## Regression testing

Regression test check for bugs that may occur in a code, that was previously working fine, after some changes are made to it. With the help of tests we identify the bugs rather than verifying everything manually after each change is made.


## testing terminology

Test Suite: It is the complete set of tests that go along with the program or application. In other words it is all the test for a project.

Test: This describes the state or circumstances in which the test are run. For example a test will raise an error if the input in an integer. A test can contain multiple assertions.

Assertion: this is the step that verifies that the data returned by the application or program is what was expected. There can be one or more assertions within a test.
